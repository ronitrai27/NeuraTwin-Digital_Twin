The AI is not some external coach. It becomes you — it learns your patterns, understands your mind, and helps you stay accountable in your own language, mindset, and rhythm.
It can:
Simulate your future based on your current path
Alert you when you’re drifting off-course
Reflect back: "Here’s how you’ve changed over time"
